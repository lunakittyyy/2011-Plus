# 2011 Plus!
2011 Plus! is an osu! skin focused on adapting the 2011 osu! skin into a usable skin for more advanced maps.

Changes from the original 2011 skin include, but may not be limited to:
- No hit 300s in osu!standard
- Better follow points in osu!standard
- No slider ends in osu!standard
- Smaller hit 100s, 50s, and misses in osu!standard
- No nightcore background beat
- No combo bursts

## A quick notice
This skin is just a result of me hacking together some assets in an image editor. I'm not an artist or graphics designer.

I'm not the best at these things, and if anyone is willing to step forward and contribute art assets or anything I'd be eternally grateful.
